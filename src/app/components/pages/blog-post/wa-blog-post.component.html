            <p class="highlight">I've been pestered and nagged by aurion17 for this one but I've finally got my first collaboration out with him after a long time, with some help from JoeBro94 as well.</p>
            <p>It's only my second project since making a return to modding and I've chosen Brescia's young super-star Sandro Tonali. A talented midfielder, hailed as the second coming of Pirlo (he does have his eyes), Tonali is extremely popular in Career Mode given his high potential and overall skill as a deep-lying play-maker.</p>
            <p>At just 19 years of age, he has already played more than 70 professional games for Brescia and has 3 Italy caps to his name. That rhyme was not intended. He's being linked with almost every top European club at this point and is on the path to stardom for sure.</p>
