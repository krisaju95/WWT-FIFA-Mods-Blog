    "post-text-content": "  Arsenal's young  French teenage midfielder Matteo Guendouzi features in this pack. Arsenal  surprised quite a few people when new manager Unai Emery decided to name the  young and inexperienced Guendouzi, a new signing this summer from Lorient,  against defending champions Manchester City. However, he proved to be the  only bright spark in an otherwise lack-luster performance from the Arsenal  side as they lost in their opening day fixture. He also played in their  second fixture as they traveled to Chelsea and once again put in an assured  display in the heart of the midfield. This pack also features fellow Arsenal  youngster Reiss Nelson, who broke into the scene last year with some  wonderful displays and had a fairly decent pre-season this year as well. It remains  to be seen how he develops under Unai Emery. The final player in the pack is  FC Barcelona's Ousmane Dembele, who endured a torrid first season after  joining in a whopping deal from Borussia Dortmund. Expected to gradually fill  the boots of the departing superstar Neymar, Dembele had a decent start in  his debut but suffered a long term injury and was out for most of last  season. This year, Valverde could move back to Barcelona's preferred 4-3-3  system, in which Dembele would slot in well in either wide-forward position.

    "post-title": "Michael Carrick - End of an Era",
    "post-text-content": "Manchester United stalwart Michael Carrick retired at the end of last season to join United's back-room staff. Michael Carrick played for a number of clubs in his career including West Ham, Tottenham Hotspur and, of course, Manchester United. He also earned 34 caps while playing for the England National Team between 2001 and 2015.  Distinctive features of his play included his inventive distribution of the ball along with his passing and crossing abilities. Carrick began his career at West Ham United, joining the youth team in 1997 and winning the FA Youth Cup two years later. He was sent on loan twice during his debut season, to Swindon Town and Birmingham City, before securing a place in the first team by the 2000–01 season. He experienced relegation in the 2002–03 season and was voted into the PFA First Division Team of the Year in the following campaign. He made more than 150 appearances for the Hammers, and in 2004, he moved to rival London club Tottenham Hotspur for a fee believed to be £3.5 million. He played an influential role at the club for two seasons before moving to Manchester United in 2006 for £18 million. From his debut onwards, Carrick was a regular in the Manchester United first team, making more than 50 appearances in his first season with them. He established himself as a key member of the team that won the Premier League in 2006–07, their first title success in four years. The following season he was part of the side that won the 2008 Champions League final, playing the full 120 minutes as they enjoyed a 6–5 penalty shootout win, with Carrick converting his spot kick, to help achieve the European Double. As of 2017, he is the only English player alongside former teammate Wayne Rooney to win the Premier League title, FA Cup, UEFA Champions League, League Cup, FA Community Shield, UEFA Europa League and FIFA Club World Cup. In winning the 2016 FA Cup, Carrick completed his collection of every domestic honour in the English game. Carrick has represented England at under-18, under-21, B and senior levels. He made his England debut in 2001 and went on to gain 34 caps without scoring a goal. Carrick has often been overlooked during his England career, with many of his contemporaries being preferred in his position. This was the case until the 2012–13 season, when Carrick established himself as a regular. He was a member of the England squad for two major tournaments, the 2006 and 2010 World Cups. Carrick decided to hang up his boots at the end of last season as he saw his playing time gradually decline over the years. He remains a part of the team setup after joining the coaching staff as an assistant. EA have released a special End of an Era card on FIFA 18 to commemorate his achievements. Kieron gives us his opinion on this card.",

    "post-title": "FIFA 18: Peter Crouch - Premium SBC",
    "post-text-content": "The tall lanky striker was recently featured in EA's latest Squad Builder Challenges. Crouch is one of 28 players to have scored 100 or more Premier League goals, holding the record for the most headed goals in Premier League history. In cumulative transfer fees, Crouch is the fifth most expensive British footballer of all-time. Crouch began his career as a trainee with Tottenham Hotspur. He failed to make an appearance for Spurs and after loan spells at Dulwich Hamlet and Swedish club IFK Hässleholm he joined Queens Park Rangers. After QPR were relegated at the end of the 2000–01 season, Portsmouth acquired Crouch on a transfer deal worth £1.5 million. He had a strong first season at Fratton Park, and after scoring 19 goals for the club, he joined Aston Villa in March 2002 for £5 million. He had a relatively poor spell at Villa, however, and was loaned out to Norwich City in 2003 before making a move to Southampton, where he re-gained his form, which would ultimately prompt his joining of Liverpool in July 2005. At Liverpool, Crouch enjoyed considerable success, winning the FA Cup and FA Community Shield in 2006 and also gained a runners-up medal in the 2007 UEFA Champions League Final. After scoring 42 goals in three seasons at Anfield, Portsmouth re-acquired him for £11 million, where he forged an effective partnership with fellow England international Jermain Defoe. He spent just one season in his second spell at Portsmouth and left for Tottenham Hotspur, where he again linked up with Defoe and Harry Redknapp. He scored a vital goal for Tottenham against Manchester City which earned the club a place in the UEFA Champions League. He scored seven goals in ten European matches for Spurs in 2010–11, but was unable to replicate this form in the Premier League. He joined Stoke City on 31 August 2011 for a club record fee of £10 million. In his first season with Stoke, he scored 14 goals and won the club's Player of the Year award. He scored eight in 2012–13 and then hit ten in both the 2013–14 and 2014–15 seasons. Crouch set a record for the most number of appearances as substitute in the Premier League, on 20 November 2017 when he came off the bench for the 143rd time against Brighton & Hove Albion, breaking the record held by Shola Ameobi. Crouch signed another one-year contract extension with the Potters in November 2017. Crouch played 34 times in 2017–18, scoring six goals as Stoke were relegated to the Championship. He has a special SBC card on FIFA 18. Kieron gives us his opinion on this card.",

Arsenal have had a disappointing season this year as they failed to qualify for the Champions League once again, finishing in 6th. However, with Arsene Wenger leaving and Unai Emery taking charge of the dugouts, there is a certain promise for change. Arsenal have already begun digging deep in the transfer market with new signings Bernd Leno and Stephan Lichtsteiner already confirmed while Greek defender Sokratis and Uruguayan midfielder Lucas Torreira are also expected to sign. Arsenal's disappointing term last year will see a large portion of their players downgraded, with the likes of Petr Cech and Hector Bellerin failing to live up to their ratings in FIFA 18.
