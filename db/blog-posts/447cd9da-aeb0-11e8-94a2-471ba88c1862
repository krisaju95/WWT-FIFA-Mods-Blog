    "Michael Carrick played for a number of clubs in his career including West Ham, Tottenham Hotspur and, of course, Manchester United. He also earned 34 caps while playing for the England National Team between 2001 and 2015. Distinctive features of his play included his inventive distribution of the ball along with his passing and crossing abilities.",
    "Carrick began his career at West Ham United, joining the youth team in 1997 and winning the FA Youth Cup two years later. He was sent on loan twice during his debut season, to Swindon Town and Birmingham City, before securing a place in the first team by the 2000-01 season. He experienced relegation in the 2002-03 season and was voted into the PFA First Division Team of the Year in the following campaign. He made more than 150 appearances for the Hammers, and in 2004, he moved to rival London club Tottenham Hotspur for a fee believed to be &#163;3.5 million. He played an influential role at the club for two seasons before moving to Manchester United in 2006 for &#163;18 million.",
    "Since his debut, Carrick was a regular in the Manchester United first team, making more than 50 appearances in his first season with them. He established himself as a key member of the team that won thePremier League in 2006-07, their first title success in four years. The following season he was part of the side that won the 2008 Champions League final, playing the full 120 minutes as they enjoyed a 6-5 penalty shootout win, with Carrick converting his spot kick, to help achieve the European Double. As of 2017, he is the only English player along-side former team-mate Wayne Rooney to win the Premier League title, FA Cup, UEFA Champions League, League Cup, FA Community Shield, UEFA Europa League and FIFA Club World Cup. In winning the 2016 FA Cup, Carrick completed his collection of every domestic honour in the English game.",
    "Carrick has represented England at under-18, under-21, B and senior levels. He made his England debut in 2001 and went on to gain 34 caps without scoring a goal. Carrick has often been overlooked during his England career, with many of his contemporaries being preferred in his position. This was the case until the 2012-13 season, when Carrick established himself as a regular. He was a member of the England squad for two major tournaments, the 2006 and 2010 World Cups.",
    "Carrick decided to hang up his boots at the end of last season as he saw his playing time gradually decline over the years. He remains a part of the team setup after joining the coaching staff as an assistant. EA have released a special End of an Era card on FIFA 18 to commemorate his achievements.",
    "Kieron gives us his opinion on this card. Watch the video below."
